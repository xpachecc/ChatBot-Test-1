# Spec Quality Gates

- Spec must include: Summary, Functional Requirements, Possible Edge Cases, Acceptance Criteria, Open Questions, and Testing Guidelines.
- Requirements must be testable and outcome-oriented.
- Acceptance criteria must be observable with clear pass/fail behavior.
- Scenarios must cover:
  - primary success path
  - at least one valid variation
  - realistic failure and edge conditions
- Avoid technical implementation details, code samples, and architecture decisions unless explicitly requested.
- If convergence is blocked, list decision-ready open questions.
