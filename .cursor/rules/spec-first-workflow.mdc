# Spec-First Workflow

- When user intent is planning, requirements, or specification, use the `spec-writer` skill.
- Gather missing inputs before drafting: `feature_name` (required), plus business intent, outcomes, constraints, assumptions, dependencies, out-of-scope, and success metrics.
- Save specs to `specs/<feature-slug>.md`.
- Use `_specs/spec_template.md` headings exactly.
- Do not start implementation until the spec is approved, unless the user explicitly asks to proceed.
- Final planning response should be concise and include the spec file path.
